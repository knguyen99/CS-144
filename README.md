Computer Science 144 Web Applications at UCLA  
Spring 2020 Cho

Developing todayâ€™s Web applications requires knowledge of a number of diverse topics, including the basic Web architecture, core Web standards (such as HTTP, HTML, CSS), JavaScript, asynchronous and functional programming, internet security, and cluster-based scalable architecture. Traditionally, these topics have been taught in different subdisciplines of computer science, so students had to take a fair number of courses to learn the basic concepts necessary to build effective and safe Web applications. The goal of this class is to teach students the most important concepts and give them first-hand experience with the basic tools for developing Web applications.

The topics covered in the class include:

Core Web standards, such as HTTP, Unicode, HTML, JSON, and CSS

Javascript programming

Web programming paradigms, including functional programming, asynchronous programming, and MVC

Web-site architecture

Web-site scalability

Web security

To help students digest the materials learned in the class, we will assign a quarter-long class project (which will be divided into multiple submissions), in which students have to build a Web site that allows users to write and publish blogs (a.k.a., mini WordPress) The software tools and development environment will be provided on the class Web site.
